# 🚀 Android App Deployment Guide

## Deployment Status

✅ **GitHub Actions workflows have been set up and triggered!**

Your push to the main branch has automatically started the deployment process. The CI/CD pipeline is now running.

## Deployment Workflows

### 1. **Automatic CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/android-build.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- ✅ Push to `main` branch (triggered)
- ✅ Push to `develop` branch  
- ✅ Pull requests to `main` branch

**What it does:**
1. 🔨 **Builds** debug APK (always succeeds)
2. 🧪 **Runs tests** to ensure code quality
3. 📦 **Creates artifacts** for download
4. 🏷️ **Creates GitHub Release** with debug APK
5. 🌐 **Deploys to GitHub Pages** for easy APK distribution
6. 💬 **Comments on commit** with download links

### 2. **Manual Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

**Trigger:** Manual execution only
- Go to **Actions** tab → **Create Signed Release** → **Run workflow**

**Features:**
- 🔐 Supports signed release APKs (when keystore is configured)
- 📝 Custom version naming and release notes
- 🎯 Production-ready releases

## Current Deployment

Since you just pushed to main, here's what's happening:

### 🔄 Live Status
Check the deployment progress:
- **Actions Tab:** https://github.com/xman-bug/github-workflows-/actions
- **Latest Run:** Look for "Android CI/CD" workflow

### 📱 Download Links (Available after build completes)
- **GitHub Releases:** https://github.com/xman-bug/github-workflows-/releases
- **Debug APK:** Will be available as `app-debug.apk`
- **Build Artifacts:** Available in Actions tab

### 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment
- **APK Distribution:** https://xman-bug.github.io/github-workflows-/downloads/

## Repository URLs

- **Main Repository:** https://github.com/xman-bug/github-workflows-
- **Actions:** https://github.com/xman-bug/github-workflows-/actions
- **Releases:** https://github.com/xman-bug/github-workflows-/releases
- **Settings:** https://github.com/xman-bug/github-workflows-/settings

## Setting Up Signed Releases (Optional)

To enable production-ready signed APKs:

### 1. Generate Keystore
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore app/keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias your-alias
```

### 2. Add Repository Secrets
Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

Add these secrets:
- `KEYSTORE_BASE64`: Base64 encoded keystore file
- `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: Your keystore password  
- `KEY_ALIAS`: Your key alias
- `KEY_PASSWORD`: Your key password

### 3. Encode Keystore
```bash
base64 -i app/keystore.jks | pbcopy  # macOS
base64 -w 0 app/keystore.jks          # Linux
```

## Testing the Deployment

### 1. **Check Actions Tab**
- Visit: https://github.com/xman-bug/github-workflows-/actions
- Look for green checkmarks ✅
- View logs for any issues

### 2. **Download and Test APK**
Once the workflow completes:
1. Go to **Releases** tab
2. Download `app-debug.apk`
3. Install on Android device
4. Verify the app launches correctly

### 3. **Verify GitHub Pages**
- Check: https://xman-bug.github.io/github-workflows-/downloads/
- Should contain downloadable APK files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Build Fails:**
- Check Actions logs for specific errors
- Ensure all files are committed properly
- Verify Gradle wrapper permissions

**Release Not Created:**
- Check if push was to `main` branch
- Verify GitHub token permissions
- Look for workflow execution in Actions tab

**APK Not Available:**
- Wait for workflow completion (usually 3-5 minutes)
- Check if artifacts were uploaded successfully
- Verify release was created in Releases tab

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ **Wait for current deployment** to complete (check Actions tab)
2. 📱 **Download and test** the debug APK
3. 🔐 **Set up signing keys** for production releases (optional)
4. 🔄 **Push more changes** to trigger additional deployments
5. 🚀 **Use manual release workflow** for version releases

## Monitoring

Your deployment is now **live and automatic**! Every push to the main branch will:
- Build the app
- Run tests  
- Create a new release
- Deploy APK files
- Notify you with download links

Check the Actions tab to monitor the current deployment progress.
