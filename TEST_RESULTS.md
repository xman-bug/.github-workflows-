### Unit Tests (JUnit)
Located in: `app/src/test/java/com/example/androidapp/`

**CalculatorTest.kt** - Comprehensive unit tests for Calculator utility class:
- ✅ `testAddition()` - Tests addition with positive, negative, and zero values
- ✅ `testSubtraction()` - Tests subtraction with various combinations
- ✅ `testMultiplication()` - Tests multiplication including edge cases
- ✅ `testDivision()` - Tests division with decimal results
- ✅ `testDivisionByZero()` - Tests exception handling for division by zero
- ✅ `testIsPrime()` - Tests prime number detection with comprehensive cases

### Instrumented Tests (Android Test Framework)
Located in: `app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/androidapp/`

**MainActivityTest.kt** - Android instrumented tests:
- Tests application context validation
- Tests MainActivity launch and initialization

## Test Results

### Debug Unit Tests
```xml
<testsuite name="com.example.androidapp.CalculatorTest" 
           tests="6" 
           skipped="0"
