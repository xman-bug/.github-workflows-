## Project Status

The Android project is now **fully functional** and ready for development:

- ✅ Complete Gradle configuration
- ✅ Proper Android app structure
- ✅ Working GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ All required resource files present
- ✅ Buildable with `./gradlew assembleDebug` or `./gradlew assembleRelease`

## Next Steps

1. Add your signing keystore (`keystore.jks`) to the `app/` directory
2. Set up the required environment variables for release builds:
   - `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
   - `KEY_ALIAS` 
   - `KEY_PASSWORD`
3. Start developing your app features in the existing structure
