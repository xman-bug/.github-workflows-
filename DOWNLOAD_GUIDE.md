## ‚ö†Ô∏è Installation Notes

### Security Settings
- **First-time installation**: Android will ask permission to install from unknown sources
- **Grant permission**: Tap "Allow" or "Install anyway"
- **This is normal**: APKs not from Google Play require this permission

### If Installation Fails
1. **Check available storage**: Ensure you have enough space
2. **Enable unknown sources**: Make sure the setting is enabled
3. **Try release APK**: If debug fails, try the release version
4. **Restart phone**: Sometimes helps with installation issues

### Updating the App
- **Install over existing**: New APK will update the existing app
- **Same package name**: Both APKs use `com.example.androidapp`
- **Version management**: Newer versions will replace older ones
